Although we don't think much about it, light illuminance can be pretty important when it comes to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Natural light is important to our health and it allows us to see and experience the world around
us.

But at the same time, Over illumination has been linked to headaches,
fatigue, medically defined stress, and even anxiety

because of this its recommended that certain illuminance levels are
maintained within different sectors of a household since its one of the most time spent places by a normal human being.

of course other than the ordinary blinds and shades which work manually, There are quite a few devices already in the market which block natural light entering a room in an automated way.

For exmaples, sansa smart wand, Switchbot curtain, IKEA fyrtur, Lutrin serena, ive shown them in my slides as well but what these do is that it opens and folds blinds with respect to a time frame given by the user or else on command. Actually These work connected to a mobile app, or a remote specifically built for the device but the issue is what i mentioned earlier which is the illuminance level recommended to maintain, therfore the user would have to decide on whether the light is enough or not according to his preference and act accordingly so that the device works as needed by the user.

Closure provides all of it and on top of that there are some extra features that makes it special.

The camera module which comes with the device would be able to identify the people ouccupying the room and adjust its settings according to priority. What i meant by priority is that when there are multiple people there would be an issue for the device to decide which set of settings to execute. So there would be order in which the settings are priritized depending on the person.

In addition, the users would be able to adjust settings in their own preference through a special mobile and connected to the device features and functionalities. These settings mainly consist of two types of modes. Which is auto and manual.

Manual mode is the one in which the user gets to decide when to open and close the blinds providing a specific time. Auto mode is the key feature focused through the device.

In auto mode, A sensor would be measureing the overoll illuminance level in the room, natural and artificial light combined, and balance out the natural light entering the room adjusting the blind levels.

Ive mentioned that the device has the capability to distinguish between artificial and natural light, but for now, the sensors are unavailable in the shops ive searched through. however it won't matter since im mainly focusing the overall illuminance levels.
